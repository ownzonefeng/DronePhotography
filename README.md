I. How to set up our project:
 - Install .apk into tablet and watch separately

II. How to test our project:
1. Open our app, you will see the interface of DeviceListActvity(). Open "settings" and find the corresponding Bebop Drone 
hotspot, click on it and connect with Bebop Drone.

2. You can see the name of the Bebop Drone from the list "Please Select from the Following Drones:", click on it and then you will
enter BebopActivity() interface.

3. Click "Take off" to fly the drone. Be carefull not to touch "Emergency" button, it will cause the drone to stop flying and drop
to the ground directly(in this way the drone will get damaged).

4. You can see 8 fly direction buttons on the control interface. On left, those 4 directions control the drone to fly parallelly,
"forward", "backward", "parallel left", "parallel right".

5. On right, those 4 directions control the drone to yaw, including "up", "down", "turn left", "turn right". If you want the drone
to turn left/right, click on the button continuously for a while, as it takes time for drone to turn a specific angle.

6. Photo-taking button is located at the left-bottom corner. Once clicking on it, a hint "Photo is taken" will appear and the photo
will be stored in local automatically(you can see from the notification whether the download is complete).

7. Video-recording button is located at the right-bottom corner. Once clicking on it, the button will turn grey, and a green timer
will appear on the screen just below "Emergency" button.
